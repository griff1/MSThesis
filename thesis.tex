\begin{acknowledgements}
Many people contributed to the completion of this thesis. I'd like to thank the UC Berkeley SwarmLab in general and the SwarmLab Global Data Plan group in particular for supporting me through the research process. In particular, I'd like to thank Professor John Kubiatowicz for his architectural guidance, for serving as my adviser, and for helping shepherd this research to completion. I'd also like to thank Nitesh Mor for many long design meetings and his sage advice on graduate studies, as well as significant contributions to the GDP sections of this thesis. I am eternally grateful to Eric Allman and Richard Pratt, who were both critical in helping me clarify the structure of SCDTs and served as frequent sounding boards. Thanks is also due to Ken Lutz for his advice and guidance in the process of producing this work. Dylan Dreyer also deserves credit and praise for substantial contributions in implementing and analyzing the simulations presented in this work.  I would also like to thank Professor Ion Stoica for his feedback on the project's direction.  Finally, I would like to thank the faculty reviewers of this work, Professors John Kubiatowicz and John Wawrzynek, for taking the time to review this thesis.
